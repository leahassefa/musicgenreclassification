# musicgenreclassification
This project implements deep learning models to classify music genres using log-transformed Mel spectrograms. Leveraging convolutional and recurrent neural networks, the models learn temporal and spectral features from short audio segments. This work builds on the GTZAN dataset, a widely used benchmark in music information retrieval.
